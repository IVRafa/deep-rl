# deep-rl
Repository documenting my projects as I study deep reinforcement learning architectures. I will be using mainly keras and tensorflow to implement while I test on the OpenAI gym.

Although I will put emphasis on coding most of these from scratch, any code that I do borrow will be cited in the code itself.

### Value based methods

- [ ] Q-learning (tabular and one-layer)
- [ ] Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- [ ] Double DQN  (DDQN) 
- [ ] DQN with prioritised replay
- [ ] Dueling DQN (DDQN)

### Policy based methods

- [ ] Policy gradient -- REINFORCE & with baseline.
- [ ] Actor critic (A2C)
- [ ] Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

### Multi-agent

- [ ] Muti-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)
